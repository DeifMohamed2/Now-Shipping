    <h2 id="section1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

    <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em></p>

    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>

    <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Full names</li>
        <li>Phone numbers</li>
        <li>Email addresses</li>
        <li>Mailing addresses (pickup and delivery addresses)</li>
        <li>Usernames</li>
        <li>Passwords</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>LOCATION DATA COLLECTION AND USAGE</h3>
        
        <p><strong>What Location Data We Collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precise Location (GPS coordinates):</strong> We collect your device's real-time precise location using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular network data when you use our delivery and tracking features.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Location:</strong> We may collect location data in the background when the app is not actively in use to provide real-time delivery tracking and updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Location History:</strong> We store historical location data for completed shipments and deliveries.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How We Use Location Data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivery Services:</strong> To enable pickups and deliveries by matching your location with available drivers and tracking shipment progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Route Optimization:</strong> To provide efficient routing for drivers and estimated arrival times for customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time Tracking:</strong> To show you the real-time location of your shipment and driver on a map.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Area Verification:</strong> To verify that your location is within our service coverage area.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> To assist with delivery issues and provide location-based customer support.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To analyze delivery patterns and improve our service quality and efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Location Accuracy:</strong> GPS is accurate to approximately 20 meters. Wi-Fi and cell tower data help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, such as indoors. However, location data is not always perfectly precise.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings. However, this may limit or prevent the use of core app features such as booking deliveries and tracking shipments.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Application Data.</strong> If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geolocation Information:</strong> We request access and permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, both continuously and while you are using our mobile application(s), to provide location-based delivery and tracking services. This includes foreground and background location access to ensure real-time shipment tracking and delivery updates. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Device Access:</strong> We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's camera (for scanning barcodes and taking delivery photos), contacts (for selecting recipient information), storage (for saving delivery receipts), and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your shipment status, delivery updates, and account notifications. If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

    <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit or use our Services.</em></p>

    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <h3>Google API</h3>

    <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <strong>Google API Services User Data Policy</strong>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>

    <p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.</strong> We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.</li>
        <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</strong> We may process your information to provide you with the requested delivery and shipping service.</li>
        <li><strong>To fulfill and manage your orders.</strong> We may process your information to fulfill and manage your shipments, delivery orders, payments, returns, and exchanges made through the Services.</li>
        <li><strong>To provide location-based services.</strong> We process your location data to match you with available drivers, provide real-time tracking, calculate delivery routes, and estimate arrival times.</li>
        <li><strong>To send administrative information to you.</strong> We may process your information to send you details about our products and services, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information related to your shipments.</li>
        <li><strong>To enable user-to-user communications.</strong> We may process your information to enable communications between you and our delivery drivers for coordination purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm or ensure safe delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section3">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>

    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        <li><strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). We use certain Google Maps Platform APIs to retrieve certain information when you make location-specific requests. This includes: Your real-time precise location (latitude and longitude coordinates), pickup and delivery addresses, route information, and estimated travel times. A full list of what we use information for can be found in section 1 titled "WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?" and in section 2 titled "HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?". Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We obtain and store on your device ("cache") your location for service delivery purposes. You may revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this document or through your device settings. The Google Maps Platform APIs that we use store and access cookies and other information on your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>With Drivers and Service Providers.</strong> We share necessary information (such as pickup/delivery locations, contact information, and shipment details) with our drivers and delivery partners to facilitate the delivery service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section4">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>

    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

    <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned order reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@nowshipping.co">info@nowshipping.co</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below or through your device settings for app permissions.</p>

    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>

    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
        <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@nowshipping.co">info@nowshipping.co</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:info@nowshipping.co">info@nowshipping.co</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

    <h2 id="section10">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></p>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
